# templates
This is an attempt to make manipulating cryptic scripts such as that of LaTex or Html easier, especially when using relatively standard templates. This project is still at experimental stage and will likely stay that way for several more months. Through performing many iterations and over relatively long period of time I expect I will gain insights on how to simplify this kind of processes.

Additionally, as I am currently still relatively new to Lisp, I am also using this project to gain more experience in the programming language, which I expect should further help me find more means for the simplifications.
